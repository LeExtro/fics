      <!-- SCENE ONE -->

      <li class="sceneheader">
        EXT. FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - EARLY MORNING, WINTER
      </li>
      <li class="scenenumber">1</li>

      <li class="action">
        The sun is barely beginning to rise with winter birds quietly CHIRPING.
        Snow gently falls onto the ground. A banner hangs across the pillars of
        the front of the university; big, bright letters spell out "HAPPY
        HOLIDAYS <em>[UNIVERSITY NAME]</em>".
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HALL</li>
      <li class="action">
        From the frosty windowsill, the SOUNDS OF BIRDS echo slightly but are
        muffled by the walls. Focus slowly switches from the window to the
        falling snow and trees, frozen over by ice and caking in thick layers of
        snow.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">CUT TO: WIDE SHOT, ROOM DOOR</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE slowly approach the door to HERO's room. The walls are sickly plain
        and pale. The weathered metal door, room number slightly askew, almost
        looming over us.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HERO'S ROOM</li>
      <li class="action">
        WE now see the room, looking down from the corner. Sunlight barely peeks
        through the shut blinds. The room is cramped and has a single bed,
        drawer and desk, all plain and well-worn. The walls are bright white and
        sterile, but look blue and cold with the dim sunlight. Notebooks,
        papers, pencils, pens and various other school items are scattered
        across the table, chaotically organized. A small tower of clothes pile
        against the side of the desk. Wrinkled covers and blankets lay atop
        HERO, slowly BREATHING.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE then see the bed, looking straight down from the ceiling. A clock
        faintly TICKS. HERO curls in the fetal position. We faintly see his body
        rising and falling with his breathing.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        And from the edge of the bed, WE see his face. His eyes are wide open
        with big dark spots underneath. The TICKING of the clock intensifies
        slowly. The sound of TINNITUS slowly increases in loudness. The vignette
        fades away when the silence, TICKING and TINNITUS are broken by a loud
        ALARM CLOCK. HERO lies in bed for a moment, before turning over to slap
        the alarm clock quiet. He stays motionless for another moment before
        getting out of bed.
      </li>
      <br />

      <!-- SCENE TWO -->

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, KITCHEN - MID MORNING</li>
      <li class="scenenumber">2</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see a frosty window with snow caking the bottom of it. Snow continues
        to fall outside of the window, coating the trees. The winter sun fills
        the kitchen with a warm, calming glow, and colours brighter than his
        dorm. We see a pot of coffee on the boil from the side.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE now look down at the stove top from the range, seeing breakfast
        sizzle in the pan. We slowly tilt down to see HERO's face looking
        slightly down while he cooks. A small smile appears on his face, before
        he looks up at us.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. UNIVERSITY, LECTURE HALL</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see the energy draining from HERO's eyes on his stone face as he
        listens on to the droning professor. The lecturer's voice starts muffled
        but slowly bleeds into an echoing clarity. HERO looks down to his
        notebooks and scribbles on, trying to catch up with the professor as
        they continue with the lecture, while we circle around him with a
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewvhlYh9wC0"
          >quiet, slow, out-of-tune and slightly eerie tune in the
          background.</a
        >
      </li>

      <li class="character">PROFESSOR no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(echoing from front of room)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ... {we will continue from yesterday with} -the musculoskeletal system.
        Page 587, chapter 17.6 of Human Physiology. You will note that te
        vertebral column consists of the cervical- {thoracic, lumbar and sacral
        vertebrae, etc. etc.}
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE stop behind his shoulder. The professor continues, but the words are
        progressively muffled. We slowly look over his shoulder to see a
        textbook open, flipped to a page about the cervical spine. EAR RINGING
        gradually bleeds while we hear HERO's HEART POUNDING against his ribs,
        growing quicker and quicker with each passing second. We sweep over his
        shoulder, swinging around to see his face, trickling with sweat and
        paranoia. The THUMPING of his heart and the ringing rise to a crescendo
        before a male, UNNAMED FRIEND shakes him out of his panic attack.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left of him, concern)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Hey, you alright there?</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(unprepared, composing self)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        I- uh... I'm fine, yeah. Just, zoned out for a second, that's all.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">You know, you've been zoning out a lot recently-</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(interrupting)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Sleep!... I mean uh- I haven't gotten the best sleep recently, honestly.
        You know... physiology being a pain and all with, all the Latin words
        and what not.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE watch HERO slowly get up from his seat, turning to scratch his head
        and shoot an awkward smile at his UNNAMED FRIEND, which we can see over
        the friend's shoulder.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        The, test isn't even in a few weeks from now. I don't know why you're
        stressing so much about it.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(hiding behind a smile)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        It's just-... again, the vocabulary is kinda iffy with me right now so,
        just trying to make sure I'm ready, right? Studying more doesn't hurt
        versus studying too little, right?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Guess so... don't kill yourself over it, though.</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Ha, yeah, yeah...!</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Anyway, we're going out for lunch again. Coming?</li>

      <li class="action">HERO takes a brief moment to think.</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">...Sure! Yeah that, sounds good!</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE stay put and watch as HERO and his UNNAMED FRIEND walk out of the
        classroom, being the last ones out. The door shuts behind them.
      </li>
      <br />

      <!-- SCENE THREE -->

      <li class="sceneheader">EXT. TOWN STREETS - EARLY AFTERNOON</li>
      <li class="scenenumber">3</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see cars speeding by us from the curb. The town is not bustling
        enough to drown out the sounds of SNOW BIRDS SINGING THEIR SONGS. Snow
        continues to gently fall and add on to thick layers of snow on the
        sidewalk.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. MOVING CAR</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see HERO's reflection in the front passenger window. HERO has his
        chin resting on a hand as he watches the cars drive by. His breath fogs
        up a small circle of moisture on the window. CONVERSATION between his
        two male friends occurs around him, which he occasionally jumps into;
        he's still relatively absent-minded. We watch him reply to bits and
        pieces of the conversation, still over his shoulder, focusing on his
        reflection.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left and back)</li>

        ... {You guys} -have any plans for Christmas? Actually surprised they're
        giving us some kind of break to begin with.

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left of, driving)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Probably gonna go back home, stay with family.</li>

      <li class="dialogue">
        Pfft, I came all the way out here just to leave family.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        The three in the car, including HERO, laugh at the remark, though HERO
        doesn't laugh as much as the other two.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">What about you, Hero? You got any plans?</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(slightly unprepared)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Oh- uhh... probably the same thing, I guess. Going back to see family
        and what not. Mom's been worried sick, so.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Oh, yeah that's gotta suck. At least you don't have to introduce a new
        girlfriend or whatever, unlike smartass over here.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO winces slightly hearing the word 'girlfriend'.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Oh screw you too, fucking virgin.</li>

      <li class="action">
        The two UNNAMED FRIENDS laugh again for a while. HERO stays a little
        quiet, but stone-faces through.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. CAFÉ</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see the three of them sitting at a table by the window. Cars slowly
        drive by the window. The snow begins to fall harder. They are engaging
        in some small talk as we get closer to the table.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">CUT TO: OVER SHOULDER, HERO</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(complaining)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ... {so} -yeah, English 2, living hell. Who would've thought
        <em>[RAND. PROF. NAME]</em> would be such a pain in the ass?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        I'm just saying, you should've listened to the fourth years. They did
        tell us not to pick any language electives. Why would you even pick
        English as an elective if you're a STEM student?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Better than <em>[RAND. M. STDT. NAME]</em> and his stupid decision to
        pick art history.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Wait, <em>art history</em>?</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">I know. Brilliant decision making.</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        And I think someone else in our physiology class picked culinary,
        however the hell she managed it.

      <li class="action">HERO is silent.</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(after a moment)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ...That's actually not a terrible idea. At least she won't end up like
        you, eating cup ramen since day one.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(quietly, mumbling)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Yeah, that... doesn't seem like the most healthy decision.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        (defensively) Hey! Cup Noodles are an important part of any nutritious
        breakfast- (cutting off) ...Oh, hey <em>[RAND. F. STDT. NAME]</em>!
        Didn't expect to see you here.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE turn around with HERO to see a FEMALE STUDENT with a striking
        resemblance to someone he once knew. She is Asian and has long,
        straight, mid back-length, black hair. She wears an brownish beige,
        oversized wool coat. She takes a seat next to him. We slowly pan off of
        his shoulder and onto hers. Everyone's voice starts becoming lightly
        muffled, with HERO's voice echoing clearly inside of him.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">PAN, TO PAN END, SLOW & WIDE, SHLDR/SHLDR</li>

        Well, seems like everyone knows you, huh? Even if they haven't seen you
        up close. Plus, you're involved in so much so, why wouldn't I?

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Decided to invite her for lunch with us. Change things up a bit.

      <li class="character">FEMALE STUDENT</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        (jokingly, sarcastic) <em>Wow am I flattered.</em> (regular tone)
        Anyway, yeah, he invited me here. I mean, I couldn't deny the offer.
        It's free food for one and, why would I refuse a chance to see the man
        himself?

        I'll, take that as a compliment. ...Enough about, me. How about you...?
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO idly listens on to the conversation between him, the FEMALE STUDENT
        and his two UNNAMED FRIENDS. He automatically replies to questions and
        adds in on to the conversation when relevant. The noises and talking
        around him get even more muffled. HERO's voice echoes louder inside of
        him.

      <li class="action">
        WE see HERO in another lecture hall, barely paying attention to to the
        lecture as he zones out. Something is clawing at his mind. Something
        that makes him hate himself when he thinks about it. His head hangs. The
        professor's voice is distant and muffled as they drone on about the
        areas of the brain.
      </li>

        etc.}

      <li class="action">
        The BELL rings. HERO packs up his belongings immediately in a seemingly
        robotic way. Once done, he lifts his head up just enough to see where he
        is walking and leaves the classroom. He pushes his way past students in
        the halls, oblivious to any CONVERSATION around him; they are all
        distant and muffled. He reaches the front doors and bodies past them,
        stumbling a little bit on the way out.

        HERO continues trudging through the crowds of people outside on campus.
        He can barely overhear other students having CONVERSATIONS about their
        plans for the winter break, their voices growing ever so more distant.
        Nothing can stop the EAR RINGING as he bumps into other students
        carelessly. He barges his way through the front doors of his dorms.

      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS</li>

      <li class="action">
        The colours around HERO are mushy, blurring and tinted with red. He
        continues wordlessly through the mostly empty halls of the dorms. He
        swings a right and up a flight of stairs to his floor. WE follow him as
        he paces down the end of the hall. We pan away from his as HERO flings
        the door to his room open and slams it shut behind him.

      <li class="action">
        WE see the back of HERO's head and shoulders, looking down from the
        ceiling. He stands still, but twitches ever so slightly. The only noise
        that could be heard is his breathing. We now slowly tilt down, keeping
        focus on him. We pan around his body slowly; he grits his hands into
        tighter and tighter fists, grinding his nails into his palms. We finally
        come to a stop in front of his head; his head his hung.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE can see HERO twitch here and there as he takes shaky breaths; tears
        are starting to drip down off of his face. He stands there, quietly
        sobbing. All we can hear is his BREATHING, WEEPING and the sounds of
        tears DRIPPING against the floor and forming a small puddle. We watch
        him stand and sob for a few minutes without pause. He then slowly brings
        his hands up to wipe his face.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO places his hands back to his sides. He is twitching and shuttering
        more as WE slowly pan off to the side. He is grinding his nails deeper
        and deeper into his palms and his knuckles turn white from how hard he
        is clenching his fists. He grits his teeth, breathing out a deep, angry,
        shaky sigh.

      <li class="character">HERO</li>

      <li class="action">HERO stays standing there for a minute.</li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO then suddenly kicks his desk chair into the wall. He is writhing
        with anger. He slams his fists down against the wall. His eyes are

        He hits the wall again, hard, with the sound reverberating through the
        room.

      <li class="character">HERO</li>

        Fuck...! Why did it have to fucking be like this...!? What did I

      <li class="action">
        His fists stick to the wall as if he is about to pound against the wall
        again. Before he can, he is interrupted by a roommate knocking on his
        room door.

      <li class="dialogue">Henry...? You in there?</li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO pauses. He stands there quietly, trying to recompose himself. He
        takes a deep, shaky breath in and does his best to sound normal.

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(after a moment)</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(holding it all in)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">...Yeah. Textbooks just, fell off my desk.</li>

      <li class="character">ROOMMATE</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ...Alright. Well, just wanted to ask if you're cooking again tonight?
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">...I will. Just give me a second.</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE can hear the ROOMMATE'S FOOTSTEPS as they walk away from the door.
        HERO is left standing in front of his wall, hands still clenching in
        fists, but less tightly, planted against his wall. He takes a moment to
        stew in his thoughts before he sighs deeply with his eyes closed and
        pushes off the wall. He trudges over to drag the chair back, sets the
        chair right and leaves his bedroom, shutting the door quietly on his way
        out.

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, KITCHEN - EVENING</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see the same frosty window again with more snow built up against it
        on the ledge. It is bleak and dark outside. The kitchen's bright, white
        light reflects off the window, showing a reflection of everything in the
        kitchen, including HERO at the stove, slowly cooking dinner.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE now look down at the stove top from the range, seeing dinner cooking
        on the stove. We slowly tilt down to see HERO's face looking slightly
        down while he cooks. A small, pained smile growing across his face while
        he continues cooking, as if he is remembering something bittersweet.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HERO'S ROOM</li>
      <li class="action">
        WE watch HERO, from the edge of the bed, finally returning to his room
        after a long day. He trudges over to his bed and collapses onto it, on
        his side. He sinks in as he breathes out a heavy sigh. Little bits of
        moonlight slip through the cracks in his blinds, barely illuminating him
        and his room. EAR RINGING starts setting in as he lies there. We get
        closer and closer to his sleepless eyes that refuse to close. The
        RINGING grows louder and louder the closer we get before it all cuts to
        black.

      <li class="action">
        The sun is barely beginning to rise with winter birds quietly CHIRPING.
        Loose snow on the ground blows around in the chilly, winter breeze. The
        same banner reading "HAPPY HOLIDAYS <em>[UNIVERSITY NAME]</em>" hangs
        across the pillars of the front of the university, quietly swaying in
        the wind.

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HALL</li>
      <li class="action">
        From the frosty windowsill, the SOUNDS OF BIRDS echo slightly but are
        muffled by the walls. Focus slowly switches from the window to the
        falling snow and trees, frozen over by ice and caking in thick layers of
        snow.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        In HERO'S ROOM, WE see his bed, looking straight down from the ceiling.
        A clock faintly TICKS. HERO curls in the fetal position. We faintly see
        his body rising and falling with his BREATHING.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="action">
        And from the edge of the bed, WE see his face. His eyes are wide open
        with big dark spots underneath. The TICKING of the clock intensifies
        slowly. The sound of TINNITUS slowly increases to and irritating
        loudness before it all cuts to black.
