        <!-- SCENE ONE -->

        <li class="sceneheader">EXT. FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - EARLY MORNING, FALL</li>
        <li class="action">
            The sun is barely beginning to rise with birds quietly chirping. A cold, gentle, breeze sweeps up the leaves scattered before the steps to the main doors and rustles through the weary maple trees.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORM HALL</li>
        <li class="action">
            From the windowsill, the sounds of birds and the breeze echo slightly but are muffled by the walls. Focus slowly switches from the window to the rustling trees outside.
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE slowly approach the door to HERO's dorm. The walls are sickly plain and pale. The weathered metal door, room number slightly askew, almost looming over US. 
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE see the room, looking down from the corner. Sunlight barely peeks through the shut blinds. The room is cramped and has a single bed, drawer and desk, all plain and well-worn. The walls are bright white and sterile. Notebooks, papers, pencils, pens and various other school items are scattered across the table, chaotically organized. A small tower of clothes pile against the side of the desk. Wrinkled covers and blankets lay atop HERO, slowly breathing.
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE see the bed, looking straight down from the ceiling. A clock faintly TICKS. HERO curls in the fetal position. WE faintly see his body rising and falling with his breathing.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="action">
            From the edge of the bed, WE see his face. His eyes are wide open with big dark spots underneath. A vignette closes in on his face. The TICKING of the clock intensifies slowly. The sound of TINNITUS slowly increases in loudness. The vignette fades away when the silence, TICKING and TINNITUS are broken by a loud ALARM CLOCK. HERO lies in bed for a moment, before turning over to slap the alarm clock quiet. He stays motionless for another moment before getting out of bed.
        </li>
        </br>


        <!-- SCENE TWO -->

        <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORM KITCHEN - MID MORNING</li>
        <li class="action">
            WE see a window slightly open from the kitchen counter. A cool breeze gently rustles the curtains. The sun fills the kitchen with a warm, calming glow and brighter colours (than his dorm). WE see a pot of coffee on the boil from the side.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="action">
            WE look down at the stove top from the range, seeing breakfast sizzle in the pan. WE slowly pan down to see HERO's face looking slightly down while he cooks. A small smile appears on his face.
