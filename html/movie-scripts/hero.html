      <!-- SCENE ONE -->

      <li class="sceneheader">
        EXT. FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - EARLY MORNING, WINTER
      </li>
      <li class="scenenumber">1</li>

      <li class="action">
        The sun is barely beginning to rise with winter birds quietly chirping.
        Snow gently falls onto the ground. A banner hangs across the pillars of
        the front of the university; big, bright letters spell out "HAPPY
        HOLIDAYS (University Name)".
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HALL</li>
      <li class="action">
        From the frosty windowsill, the sounds of birds echo slightly but are
        muffled by the walls. Focus slowly switches from the window to the
        falling snow and trees, frozen over by ice and caking in thick layers of
        snow.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="action">
        WE slowly approach the door to HERO's dorm. The walls are sickly plain
        and pale. The weathered metal door, room number slightly askew, almost
        looming over us.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORMS, HERO'S ROOM</li>
      <li class="action">
        WE now see the room, looking down from the corner. Sunlight barely peeks
        through the shut blinds. The room is cramped and has a single bed,
        drawer and desk, all plain and well-worn. The walls are bright white and
        sterile, but look blue and cold with the dim sunlight. Notebooks,
        papers, pencils, pens and various other school items are scattered
        across the table, chaotically organized. A small tower of clothes pile
        against the side of the desk. Wrinkled covers and blankets lay atop
        HERO, slowly breathing.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="action">
        WE then see the bed, looking straight down from the ceiling. A clock
        faintly TICKS. HERO curls in the fetal position. We faintly see his body
        rising and falling with his breathing.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="action">
        And from the edge of the bed, WE see his face. His eyes are wide open
        with big dark spots underneath. A vignette closes in on his face. The
        TICKING of the clock intensifies slowly. The sound of TINNITUS slowly
        increases in loudness. The vignette fades away when the silence, TICKING
        and TINNITUS are broken by a loud ALARM CLOCK. HERO lies in bed for a
        moment, before turning over to slap the alarm clock quiet. He stays
        motionless for another moment before getting out of bed.
      </li>
      <br />

      <!-- SCENE TWO -->

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORM KITCHEN - MID MORNING</li>
      <li class="scenenumber">2</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see frosty window with snow caking the bottom of it. Snow continues
        to fall outside of the window, coating the trees. The winter sun fills
        the kitchen with a warm, calming glow and brighter colours (than his
        dorm). We see a pot of coffee on the boil from the side.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="action">
        WE now look down at the stove top from the range, seeing breakfast
        sizzle in the pan. We slowly tilt down to see HERO's face looking
        slightly down while he cooks. A small smile appears on his face, before
        he looks up at us.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. LECTURE HALL</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see the energy draining from HERO's eyes on his stone face as he
        listens on to the droning professor. The lecturer's voice starts muffled
        but slowly bleeds into an echoing clarity. HERO looks down to his
        notebooks and scribbles on, trying to catch up with the professor as
        they continue with the lecture, while we circle around him with
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewvhlYh9wC0"
          >quiet, slow, out-of-tune, eerie music in the background.</a
        >
        We stop behind his shoulder.
      </li>

      <li class="character">PROFESSOR no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(echoing from front of room)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ... {we will continue from yesterday with} -the musculoskeletal system.
        Page 587, chapter 17.6 of Human Physiology. You will note that te
        vertebral column consists of the cervical- {thoracic, lumbar and sacral
        vertebrae, etc. etc.}
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        The professor continues, but the words are progressively muffled. WE
        slowly look over his shoulder to see a textbook open, flipped to a page
        about the cervical spine. EAR RINGING gradually bleeds while we hear
        HERO's HEART POUNDING against his ribs, growing quicker and quicker with
        each passing second. We sweep over his shoulder, swinging around to see
        his face, trickling with sweat and paranoia. The THUMPING of his heart
        and the ringing rise to a crescendo before a male, UNNAMED FRIEND shakes
        him out of his panic attack.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left of him, concern)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Hey, you alright there?</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(unprepared, composing self)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        I- uh... I'm fine, yeah. Just, zoned out for a second, that's all.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">You know, you've been zoning out a lot recently-</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(interrupting)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Sleep!... I mean uh- I haven't gotten the best sleep recently, honestly.
        You know... physiology being a pain and all with, all the latin words
        and what not.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE watch HERO slowly get up from his seat, turning to scratch his head
        and shoot an awkward smile at his UNNAMED FRIEND which we can see over
        their shoulder.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        The, test isn't even in a few weeks from now. I don't know why you're
        stressing so much about it.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(hiding behind a smile)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        It's just-... again, the vocabulary is kinda iffy with me right now so,
        just trying to make sure I'm ready, right? Studying more doesn't hurt
        versus studying too little, right?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Guess so... don't kill yourself over it, though.</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Ha, yeah, yeah...!</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Anyway, we're going out for lunch again. Coming?</li>

      <li class="action">HERO takes a brief moment to think.</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">...Sure! Yeah that, sounds good!</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE stay put and watch as HERO and his UNNAMED FRIEND walk out of the
        classroom, being the last ones out. The door shuts behind them.
      </li>
      <br />

      <!-- SCENE THREE -->

      <li class="sceneheader">EXT. TOWN STREETS - EARLY AFTERNOON</li>
      <li class="scenenumber">3</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see cars speeding by us from the curb. The town is not bustling
        enough to drown out the sounds of snow birds singing their songs. Snow
        continues to gently fall and add on to thick layers of snow on the
        sidewalk.
      </li>

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. MOVING CAR</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see HERO's reflection in the front passenger window. HERO has his
        chin resting on a hand as he watches the cars drive by. His breath fogs
        up a small circle of the window. Conversation between his two male
        friends occurs around him, which he occasionally jumps into; he's still
        relatively absent-minded. We watch him reply to bits and pieces of the
        conversation, still over his shoulder, focusing on his reflection.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left and back)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ... {You guys} -have any plans for Christmas? Actually surprised they're
        giving us some kind of break to begin with.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(left of, driving)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Probably gonna go back home, stay with family.</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(jokingly)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Pfft, I came all the way out here just to leave family.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        The three in the car, including HERO, laugh at the remark, though HERO
        doesn't laugh as much as the other two.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">What about you, Hero? You got any plans?</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(slightly unprepared)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Oh- uhh... probably the same thing, I guess. Going back to see family
        and what not. Mom's been worried sick, so.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Oh, yeah that's gotta suck. At least you don't have to introduce a new
        girlfriend or whatever, unlike smartass over here.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO winces slightly hearing the word 'girlfriend'.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Oh screw you too, damn virgin.</li>

      <li class="action">
        The two UNNAMED FRIENDS laugh again for a while. HERO stays a little
        quiet, but stone-faces through.
      </li>

      <li class="sceneheader">INT. CAFÉ</li>

      <li class="action">
        WE see the three of them sitting at a table by the window. Cars slowly
        drive by the window. The snow begins to fall harder. They are engaging
        in some small talk as we get closer to the table.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">CUT TO: OVER SHOULDER, HERO</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(complaining)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        {...so} -yeah, English 2, living hell. Who would've thought
        <em>[RAND. PROF. NAME]</em> would be such a pain in the ass?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        I'm just saying, you should've listened to the fourth years. They did
        tell us not to pick any language electives. Why would you even pick
        English as an elective if you're a STEM student?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Better than <em>[RAND. M. STDT. NAME]</em> and his stupid decision to
        pick art history.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Wait, <em>art history</em>?</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="dialogue">I know. Brilliant decision making.</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        And I think someone else in our physiology class picked culinary,
        however the hell she managed it.
      </li>

      <li class="action">HERO is silent.</li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(after a moment)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        ...That's actually not a terrible idea. At least she won't end up like
        you, eating cup ramen since day one.
      </li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(quietly, mumbling)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Yeah, that... doesn't seem like the most healthy decision.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        (defensively) Hey! Cup Noodles are an important part of any nutritious
        breakfast- (cutting off) ...Oh, hey <em>[RAND. F. STDT. NAME]</em>!
        Didn't expect to see you here.
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        WE turn around with HERO to see a FEMALE STUDENT with a striking
        resemblance to someone he once knew. She is Asian and has long,
        straight, mid back-length, black hair. She wears an oversized, brownish
        beige, oversized, wool coat. She takes a seat next to him. We slowly pan
        off of his shoulder and onto hers. Everyone's voice starts becoming
        lightly muffled, with HERO's voice echoing clearly inside of him.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">PAN BEGIN, SLOW & WIDE, SHLDR - SHLDR</li>

      <li class="character">FEMALE STUDENT</li>
      <li class="dialogue">"Henry", is it? Heard a lot about you!</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(a bit nervous)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">Oh...? Why would, that be...?</li>

      <li class="character">FEMALE STUDENT</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Well, seems like everyone knows you, huh? Even if they haven't seen you
        up close. Plus, you're involved in so much so, why wouldn't I?
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 1</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        Decided to invite her for lunch with us. Change things up a bit.
      </li>

      <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND no. 2</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(smugly)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">

      <li class="dialogue">
        <em>Shut the fuck up man, jeez.</em>
      </li>

      <li class="character">FEMALE STUDENT</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        (jokingly, sarcastic) <em>Wow am I flattered.</em> (regular tone) Anyway,
        yeah, he invited me here. I mean, I couldn't deny the offer. It's free
        food for one and, why would I refuse a chance to see the man himself?
      </li>

      <li class="action">HERO is blushing.</li>

      <li class="character">HERO</li>
      <li class="parenthetical">(flattered, slightly awkward)</li>
      <li class="dialogue">
        I'll, take that as a compliment. ...Enough about, me. How about you...?
      </li>

      <li class="action">
        HERO idly listens on to the conversation between him, the FEMALE STUDENT
        and his two UNNAMED FRIENDS. He automatically replies to questions and
        adds in on to the conversation when relevant. The noises and talking
        around him get even more muffled. HERO's voice echoes louder inside of
        him.
      </li>

      <li class="transition">PAN END INTO POV, F. STDT.</li>
