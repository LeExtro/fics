        <!-- SCENE ONE -->

        <li class="sceneheader">EXT. FRONT OF UNIVERSITY - EARLY MORNING, FALL</li>
        <li class="scenenumber">1</li>
        
        <li class="action">
            The sun is barely beginning to rise with birds quietly chirping. A cold, gentle, breeze sweeps up the leaves scattered before the steps to the main doors and rustles through the weary maple trees.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORM HALL</li>
        <li class="action">
            From the windowsill, the sounds of birds and the breeze echo slightly but are muffled by the walls. Focus slowly switches from the window to the rustling trees outside.
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE slowly approach the door to HERO's dorm. The walls are sickly plain and pale. The weathered metal door, room number slightly askew, almost looming over us. 
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE now see the room, looking down from the corner. Sunlight barely peeks through the shut blinds. The room is cramped and has a single bed, drawer and desk, all plain and well-worn. The walls are bright white and sterile. Notebooks, papers, pencils, pens and various other school items are scattered across the table, chaotically organized. A small tower of clothes pile against the side of the desk. Wrinkled covers and blankets lay atop HERO, slowly breathing.
        </li>
        </br>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE then see the bed, looking straight down from the ceiling. A clock faintly TICKS. HERO curls in the fetal position. We faintly see his body rising and falling with his breathing.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="action">
            And from the edge of the bed, WE see his face. His eyes are wide open with big dark spots underneath. A vignette closes in on his face. The TICKING of the clock intensifies slowly. The sound of TINNITUS slowly increases in loudness. The vignette fades away when the silence, TICKING and TINNITUS are broken by a loud ALARM CLOCK. HERO lies in bed for a moment, before turning over to slap the alarm clock quiet. He stays motionless for another moment before getting out of bed.
        </li>
        </br>


        <!-- SCENE TWO -->

        <li class="sceneheader">INT. DORM KITCHEN - MID MORNING</li>
        <li class="scenenumber">2</li>

        <li class="action">
            WE see a window slightly open from the kitchen counter. A cool breeze gently rustles the curtains. The sun fills the kitchen with a warm, calming glow and brighter colours (than his dorm). We see a pot of coffee on the boil from the side.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="action">
            WE now look down at the stove top from the range, seeing breakfast sizzle in the pan. We slowly pan down to see HERO's face looking slightly down while he cooks. A small smile appears on his face, before he looks up at us.
        </li>
        </br>

        <li class="sceneheader">INT. LECTURE HALL</li>

        <li class="action">
            WE see the energy draining from HERO's eyes on his stone face as he listens on to the droning professor. The lecturer's voice starts muffled but slowly bleeds into an echoing clarity. HERO looks down to his notebooks and scribbles on, trying to catch up with the professor as they continue with the lecture, while we circle around him with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewvhlYh9wC0">quiet, slow, out-of-tune, eerie music in the background.</a> We stop behind his shoulder.
        </li>

        <li class="character">PROFESSOR</li>
        <li class="parenthetical">(echoing from front of room)</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            ... (we will continue from yesterday with) -the musculoskeletal system. Page 587, chapter 17.6 of Human Physiology. You will note that te vertebral column consists of the cervical- (thoracic, lumbar and sacral vertebrae, etc. etc.)
        </li>

        <li class="action">
            The professor continues, but the words are progressively muffled. WE slowly look over his shoulder to see a textbook open, flipped to a page about the cervical spine. EAR RINGING gradually bleeds while we hear HERO's HEART POUNDING against his ribs, growing quicker and quicker with each passing second. We sweep over his shoulder, swinging around to see his face, trickling with sweat and paranoia. The THUMPING of his heart and the ringing rise to a crescendo before an UNNAMED FRIEND shakes him out of his panic attack.
        </li>

        <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND</li>
        <li class="parenthetical">(left of him, concern)</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            Hey, you alright there?
        </li>

        <li class="character">HERO</li>
        <li class="parenthetical">(unprepared, composing self)</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            I- uh... I'm fine, yeah. Just, zoned out for a second, that's all.
        </li>

        <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            You know, you've been zoning out a lot recently-
        </li>

        <li class="character">HERO</li>
        <li class="parenthetical">(interrupting)</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            Sleep!... I mean uh- I haven't gotten the best sleep recently, honestly. You know... physiology being a pain and all with, all the latin words and what not.
        </li>

        <li class="action">
            WE watch HERO slowly get up from his seat, turning to scratch his head and shoot an awkward smile at his UNNAMED FRIEND which we can see over their shoulder.
        </li>

        <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            The, test isn't even in a few weeks from now. I don't know why you're stressing so much about it.
        </li>

        <li class="character">HERO</li>
        <li class="parenthetical">(hiding behind a smile)</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            It's just-... again, the vocabulary is kinda iffy with me right now so, just trying to make sure I'm ready, right? Studying more doesn't hurt versus studying too little, right?
        </li>
        
        <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            Guess so... don't kill yourself over it, though.
        </li>

        <li class="character">HERO</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            Ha, yeah, yeah...!
        </li>

        <li class="character">UNNAMED FRIEND</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            Anyway, we're going out for lunch again. Coming?
        </li>

        <li class="action">
            HERO takes a brief moment to think.
        </li>

        <li class="character">HERO</li>
        <li class="dialogue">
            ...Sure! Yeah that, sounds good!
        </li>
        
        <li class="action">
            WE stay put and watch as HERO and his UNNAMED FRIEND walk out of the classroom, being the last ones out. The door shuts behind them.
        </li>
        </br>
